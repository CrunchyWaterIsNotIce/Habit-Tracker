# Secondary Name -- "Brew & Do" (Matcha) Habit Tracker
*Design components can be seen __[here](https://www.figma.com/design/pnuarbwdzvNIFB0CaXmIQu/App-Design-Spring-Break?node-id=4-2)__.*

This was created in Spring Break '25 to learn more about xCode development, 
basic data storage, and the overall creation of making a polished app.

The app serves as a basic habit tracker where a user can log habits, edit them,
and mark as either completed or incomplete. The user can also customize the
order of each habit by dragging and dropping. Lastly, there is a daily streak system
to motivate the user to complete their habits.
